My modified HU layout that allows me to enter ä/Ä and å/Å on an
otherwise Hungarian keyboard layout. (The third Swedish accented
letter ö/Ö is already available on the standard Hungarian layout,
since it is also part of the Hungarian alphabet).

Usage:
- edit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/hu and change the relevant part;
- restart X.

The layout makes å/Å available on AltGr+s/S, making space for this
by moving đ from AltGr+s to AtrGr+d, Đ from AltGr+d to AltGr+D.

The relevant part of the layout file (after modification), near
the bottom:

    key <AC01>  { [ a, A, adiaeresis, Adiaeresis ] };
    key <AC02>  { [ s, S,      aring,      Aring ] };
    key <AC03>  { [ d, D,    dstroke,    Dstroke ] };
