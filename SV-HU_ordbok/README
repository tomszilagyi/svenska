These resources allow you to create a pdf edition of Svensk-Ungersk Ordbok
by György Lakó (chief editor), 2nd ed., Budapest, 1972. Based on resources
freely downloadable from Project Runeberg: http://runeberg.org

You will need a Linux system with Ghostscript and AWK.

The make.sh shell script automates the process:
- downloads original page images and OCR-ed pages containing metadata;
- converts downloaded pages from png to pdf;
- parses indices from html files and creates pdfmarks;
- merges it all together to form a pdf with bookmarks.

The bookmarks contain a hierarchy of the alphabet, with children nodes
containing the first word on each page. Thus, looking up words is just
as easy as with a printed edition.
